I walked along the avenue
I never thought I'd meet a girl like you
Meet a girl like you
With auburn hair and tawny eyes
The kind of eyes that hypnotize me through
Hypnotize me through
And I ran, I ran so far away
I just ran, I ran all night and day
I couldn't get away
A cloud appears above your head
A beam of light comes shining down on you
Shining down on you
The cloud is moving nearer still
Aurora Borealis comes in view
Aurora comes in view
And I ran, I ran so far away
I just ran, I ran all night and day
I couldn't get away
Reached out a hand to touch your face
You're slowly disappearing from my view
Appearing from my view
Reached out a hand to try again
I'm floating in a beam of light with you
A beam of light with you
And I ran, I ran so far away
I just ran, I ran all night and day
And I ran, I ran so far away
I just ran, I couldn't get away
She's got it
She's got it
Who's that girl
Who's that girl yeah
Who's that girl
Who's that lovely girl in the corner
She's so fine
Oh how I wish that she was mine
I want to hold her
To make her mine
Whose that lovely girl in the corner
She dance and sings
She looks like from a movie scene
Maybe a hero is in her dreams
Who's that girl
Who's that girl yeah
Who's that girl
Who's that lovely girl in the corner
She's so fine
She hypnotized me with desire
I wanna gold her
She gets me high
Shes got it
Love and long
She's got it
Long and on
She's got it
Tender thought
I want to holder he
To make her mint
Who's that girl
Who's that girl yeah
Who's that girl
I hear voices but there's no one there
You speak to me in another language
Computer says it's a binary code
It's such a pity, I can't understand it

It's not me talking
It's not me talking

I see a ship from a golden sky
I sent a message, will they understand it?
Computer's ready but to overload
This isn't happening the way I planned it

It's not me talking
It's not me talking
It's not me talking
It's not me talking
Sending messages

It's not me talking
It's not me talking

I made a contact with another world
Another being from another planet
Another time and another place
Another galaxy, another planet

It's not me talking
It's not me talking
It's not me talking
It's not me talking


You got me talking, talking
Talking, talking
You got me talking, talking
Talking, talking

You got me talking
You got me talking, talking
Talking, talking
