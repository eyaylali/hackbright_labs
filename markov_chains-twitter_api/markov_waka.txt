Waka flaka, best stay out my lane because I'm thugged out

Free my girl weezy n free my girl gucci
Young money

I'm in Riverdale on 85, at Annlers's eatin' sum' Soul Food
County attitude let me know if you down to
Party all night wit' my people
And if yo' ass go hungry man them old folk's they gone feed you
I bring Drama like Sammy Sam I'm so point five Twista, Bun
Do or Die car clean no suit and tie
Ghetto boy like Willie G, Cuttier wood grains like I'm Bill see, I hold the flame like Bun 
I ain't from the South that's Ludacris that's country shit fish and grits
Yall full of bits, wet paint, big rims, you can't help, but done notice it
When the beat is in dark shit, so coolin' it wit' my van
Sickest shit that I have
Country hell a little Mayonaise, yall' in Riverdale where we at

I'm from the south Southern Hospitality
Soul food dinners, dinners, dinners, dinners, dinners, dinners
I'm from the south where the old folks' they don't mind they business
Tricked cars is our culture we sum' heavy spenders
Ca-Candy Paint and Gold Teeth

And I'm sittin' low in my old school, and my loces on, and I'm so cool
And my top it drops, and there's no roof
When I'm shinin' on it's my gold tooth
I'm trill as hell, and I'm heavy set
Pray to the Lord, but don't get it bent
I'm from the Hood, and I represent, and I turn it up like the deficit
I'm from Texas, Cadillac no Lexus
That we ride on four suicide doors, and park no places
So you best not test us cuz' we'll get reckless
Catch you on yo' block wit' that big black glock take part of yo' necklace (necklace)
Tell me who gon' check we outside down for the hood we gon' ride
My gladiater's, yeah they go live wit' them dayton's and them 4
So watch yo' step, and know yo' place, you ain't trill don't show yo' face
Cause I'll pull that, and I'll catch a case, and I'll leave the scene wit' no trace


Luda!!!
Fresh out the shop and the candy coated Cadillac stacked on amazin' wheels
Seats look like I hollered at the Reeces peanut butter cup, and then made a deal
Trucks shakin' like jellied honey's ready to check the spread
Cuz' I get that cheese, and I sandwich myself between the bread
So keep yo' mind on yo' riches, and get yo' hoes right
Cuz' in these streets you not safe unless yo' codes right
Your southern living is like something you ain't never seen
Ask any hustler his favorite color is money green
Blacked out tint white wall spinnin'
Lookin' for the neckbone, hamhock, collard green, cornbread eatin' women
We sum country certified gangsta's in the south
When you speak about who's hottest watch yo' (watch yo') mouth


I'm from the south Southern Hospitality
Soul food dinners, dinners, dinners, dinners, dinners, dinners
I'm from the south where the old folks' they don't mind they business
Tricked cars is our culture we sum' heavy spenders
Ca-Candy Paint and Gold Teeth
See, my friends showed me so much
Good or bad, they all I had
Reminisce on the past
And the to the ones that passed... lift the glass
See my friends... DOWN
All for one, one for all... We gon swang
If you ballin', do yo thang
Tell a hater kiss your ass
Where ya'll was when we was eating dolla menus?
So close to a homeless man pickin' trash
See my friends, they was all I had
They showed me so much unconditional love... shorty real
Shit I'm mentally home alone, so I'm kickin' down does
Lying girls on flos'
See my friend they all I had, showed me so much good or bad
You don't like how we live, girl kiss our ass

If you if you if you ballin' then put yo cup up
If you if you if you ballin' then put yo cup up
If you if you if you ballin' throw your top back
If you if you if you ballin' throw your top back

They wanna see me dead and locked up
They wanna see me dead and locked up
If you ballin' if you if you if you ballin'
Put your cup up, why they wanna see me locked up?
